# Organization Community Health Files

Welcome to the `.github` repository of our organization! This repository serves as the central place for our community health files. Here, we store default files that are automatically used by all repositories in our organization unless a repo has its own version of these files.

## Purpose

This repository ensures consistency across our organization's projects by providing common templates and guidelines for:
- Issue templates
- Pull request templates
- Contributing guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Code of conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)
- Security policies (`SECURITY.md`)
- Support resources (`SUPPORT.md`)

## How It Works

When you create an issue or a pull request in any repository within our organization, GitHub will use the corresponding templates from this repository if the specific repository doesn't contain its own versions of those files.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributing to this `.github` repository means you are helping to shape the workflow and community practices for all our projects. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

1. **Propose Changes**: If you think a template or guideline could be improved, please feel free to suggest changes. This can be done by opening an issue to discuss your ideas or directly submitting a pull request with your proposed modifications.
   
2. **Update Documents**: Keeping documents relevant and up-to-date is crucial. If you notice outdated information or practices, please update them and submit a pull request.

3. **Review Pull Requests**: Participate in the review process for pull requests to ensure our community health files are accurate and effective.

## Usage

To use the files in this repository:
1. Simply create your new repository under our organization. It will automatically inherit these community health files unless specified otherwise.
2. If you need to override any file for a specific project, add a new version of that file to your project's root directory. This new file will supersede the one stored here in `.github`.

## Feedback and Support

If you have any feedback, questions, or need assistance with using the community health files, please open an issue in this repository, and someone from our team will assist you as soon as possible.

Thank you for contributing to the consistency and health of our organization's projects!
